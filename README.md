Training at Axsos
This repository contains the outputs of my training in web development and software engineering. It is divided into three main sections: Web Fundamentals, Java, and MERN stack.

Web FundamentalsIn 
this section, you will find projects and exercises that cover the basics of web development using the following technologies:
HTML (HyperText Markup Language): The standard markup language used to create web pages. It provides the structure and layout of web content.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): A style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. It enhances the appearance of web pages by adding styles, colors, and layouts.
JavaScript: A versatile scripting language that enables dynamic interactions and functionality on web pages. It is used for both client-side and server-side development.
MySQL: A popular relational database management system that helps store and manage data in a structured way, commonly used with web applications to manage databases.

Java
This section focuses on Java programming and includes:
Java: A robust, high-level programming language used for building a wide range of applications, from mobile apps to enterprise systems.
Java OOP (Object-Oriented Programming): A programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data and code to manipulate that data. It promotes code reuse and scalability.
Spring Boot: An open-source Java-based framework used to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications with minimal configuration.

MERN Stack
The MERN stack section showcases full-stack web development projects using:

MongoDB: A NoSQL database that provides a flexible, scalable solution for storing data as JSON-like documents.
Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs with minimal overhead.
React.js: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications, by creating reusable UI components.
Node.js: A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be used for server-side development, enabling the building of fast and scalable network applications.
